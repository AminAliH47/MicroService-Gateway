In this service, you can Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete users
by using the Rest Full API request to the service.

**Gateway service** connect to **Users service** with **gRPC**,
It receives the data from the user service.

## ‚ö† Important ‚ö†
To send and get users datas, the Users service must be active.

[Users Service](https://github.com/AminAliH47/MicroService-Users)

<hr>

## üèÅ Run the service
**Gateway service is dockerized.** 
This means that the running of the project is very simple.

‚ö† Naturally, Docker must be installed on your system. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

‚ö† If you haven't already run the Users service, run this command in your terminal.
to create and config _users_network_ in Docker.
```commandline
$ docker network create users_network -d bridge --gateway 10.5.0.1 --subnet 10.5.0.0/16
```

Then run this command in the main root of project:

linux/macOS:
```commandline
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

after that you can open [10.5.0.1:8041](http://10.5.0.1:8041/) URL 
and use the Gateway service.

also you can test APIs with **Swagger UI** docs in [10.5.0.1:8041/docs/](http://10.5.0.1:8041/docs/) URL

<hr>

## ‚úÖ Use the project
